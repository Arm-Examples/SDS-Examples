# SDS Application for Alif AppKit-E7-AIML with SDSIO using USB Interface

This application demonstrates how to test DSP and ML algorithms using the SDS framework.
It lets you record and play back real-world data streams on physical hardware, feeding
them to your algorithm for testing. The data streams are stored in SDS data files.

## Pre-Requisite

To run this example:

- Install [Keil Studio for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.keil-studio-pack) and run a Blinky example on the board to verify tool installation.
- Clone, build and install development version of the SDS-Framework pack from:
  - `https://github.com/ARM-software/SDS-Framework.git`
- Setup the [Python environment](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#setup) for running the SDS Utilities.
- Clone, build and install development version of the Alif Ensemble CMSIS DFP pack from:
  - `git clone https://github.com/VladimirUmek/alif_ensemble-cmsis-dfp.git`

## Alif AppKit-E7-AIML

The [Alif AppKit-E7-AIML](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/alif-semiconductor-appkit-e7-aiml-gen-2-140e28d/projects/)
features a dual-core Cortex-M55 each paired with an Ethos-U55 NPU.

Before using this SDS example on the board it is required to program the ATOC of the device using
the Alif SETOOLS.
Refer to the section [Usage](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/ensemble-alifsemiconductor/overview/)
in the overview page of the Alif Semiconductor Ensemble DFP/BSP for information on how to setup
these tools.

In VS Code use the menu command **Terminal - Run Tasks** and execute:

- `"Alif: Install M55_HE or M55_HP debug stubs (single core configuration)"`

For Windows ensure that the Terminal default is Git Bash or PowerShell.

> Note:
>
> - Configure J15 to position SE (Secure UART) to enable SETOOLS communication with the device.
> - Configure J15 to position U4 (UART4) to see STDIO messages from the application.

## Projects

The `SDS.csolution.yml` application is pre-configured for [AppKit-E7-AIML](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/alif-semiconductor-appkit-e7-aiml-gen-2-140e28d/projects/).
It contains two projects:

- **`DataTest.cproject.yml`**: Verifies the SDSIO interface on hardware.
- **`AlgorithmTest.cproject.yml`**: Verifies a user algorithm with recording and playback of SDS data files.

## Layer Type: Board and Layer Type: SDSIO

The board layer implements the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) layer.
The SDSIO layer implements communication layer that communicates with SDSIO-Server.

- `Board/AppKit-E7_M55_HP/Board_HP.clayer.yml` provides board/device drivers
- `sdsio/usb/sdsio_usb.clayer.yml` provides the **USB Interface** for SDS I/O communication interface

## Build Types

- **`DebugRec`**: Debug version of application used for recording of generated input data and results of simple checksum algorithm output data.
- **`DebugPlay`**: Debug version of application used for verification of SDS component, play back the previously recorded SDS file and verify results of simple checksum algorithm.
- **`ReleaseRec`**: Release version of application used for recording of generated input data and results of simple checksum algorithm output data.
- **`ReleasePlay`**: Release version of application used for verification of SDS component, play back the previously recorded SDS file and verify results of simple checksum algorithm.

> Note:
>
> Only difference between `Debug` and `Release` targets is compiler optimization level and debug information.

For more details, refer to the [SDS Template Application](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/template.html).

## DataTest Project

The DataTest project allows you to verify the SDS I/O communication and it is recommended
to use this project first.

Begin by starting the [SDSIO-Server](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sdsio-server).
Open Terminal and type `sdsio-server.py usb`.
Check [SDS Utilities](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html) configuration
if SDSIO-Server is not found.

**SDSIO-Server Output:**

```bash
>sdsio-server.py usb
Press Ctrl+C to exit.
Starting USB Server...
Waiting for SDSIO Client USB device...
```

Now open CMSIS view in VS Code to build and run the project using the following steps:

1. Use **Manage Solution Settings** and select as Active Project **DataTest** with Build Type **DebugRec**.
2. **Build solution** creates the executable image.
3. Connect the PRG USB (J2) of the AppKit-E7-AIML and configure J15 switch for SETOOLS (SE position).
4. If not already done, download debug stubs using `"Alif: Install M55_HE or M55_HP debug stubs (single core configuration)"` task.
5. **Load application to target** to download the application to the board.
6. Configure J15 for UART4 (U4 position) and use the VS Code **Serial Monitor** to observe the application output (STDIO).
7. Connect the SOC USB (J1) of the AppKit-E7-AIML to the PC running SDSIO-Server.
8. Reset the board with RESET (SW1) button and observe the application output (STDIO) like below

```txt
Connection to SDSIO-Server established via USB interface
 :
12% idle
No object detected
```

alternatively if SDSIO-Server is not reachable or not running you will see the output:

```txt
SDS I/O USB interface initialization failed or 'sdsio-server usb' unavailable!
Ensure that SDSIO-Server is running, then restart the application!
```

### Recording Test

To execute the **recording** test, just:

1. Press the joystick (SW2) on the board to start recording.
2. Press the joystick (SW2) again to stop recording.

**SDSIO-Server Output:**

```bash
>sdsio-server.py usb
Press Ctrl+C to exit.
Starting USB Server...
Waiting for SDSIO Client USB device...
USB Server running.
Ping received.
Record:   DataInput (.\DataInput.0.sds).
Record:   DataOutput (.\DataOutput.0.sds).
..............
Closed:   DataInput (.\DataInput.0.sds).
Closed:   DataOutput (.\DataOutput.0.sds).
```

**Serial Monitor Output:**

```txt
SDS recording (#0) started
22% idle
No object detected
No object detected
No object detected
SDS recording (#0) stopped
====
```

Each run records two files: `DataInput.<n>.sds` and `DataOutput.<0>.sds` in the directory
where SDSIO-Server was started. `<n>` is a sequential number.

#### Check SDS Files

The [SDS-Check](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sds-check)
utility verifies SDS files for consistency. For example:

```bash
>sds-check.py -s DataInput.0.sds
File Name         : DataInput.0.sds
File Size         : 2.212.000 bytes
Number of Records : 20
Recording Time    : 6 s
Recording Interval: 320 ms
Data Size         : 2.211.840 bytes
Data Block        : 110.592 bytes
Data Rate         : 345.600 byte/s
Max Jitter        : 1 ms, in record 4
Max Delta Time    : 321 ms, in record 4
Validation passed
```

### Playback Test

To execute the **playback** test, follow the steps below:

1. Use **Manage Solution Settings** and select as Active Project **DataTest** with Build Type **DebugPlay**.
2. **Build solution** creates the executable image.
3. Connect the PRG USB (J2) of the AppKit-E7-AIML and configure J15 switch for SETOOLS (SE position).
4. If not already done, download debug stubs using `"Alif: Install M55_HE or M55_HP debug stubs (single core configuration)"` task.
5. **Load application to target** to download the application to the board.
6. Configure J15 for UART4 (U4 position) and use the VS Code **Serial Monitor** to observe the application output (STDIO).
7. Connect the SOC USB (J1) of the AppKit-E7-AIML to the PC running SDSIO-Server.
8. Reset the board with RESET (SW1) button and observe the application output (STDIO).
9. Press a joystick (SW2) on the board to start playback of `DataInput` and recording of `DataOutput`.
10. Wait for playback to finish, it will finish automatically when all data from `DataInput.0.sds` SDS file was played back.

The stream `DataInput.<n>.sds` is read back and the algorithm processes this data. The stream `DataOutput.<m>.sds` is written whereby `<m>` is the next available file index.

> Note:
>
> The playback implementation replays recordings as quickly as possible and does not
> account for timestamp data. During playback, the ML system receives the same recorded
> input data, so timing information is not relevant in this context.

**SDSIO-Server Output:**

```bash
>sdsio-server.py usb
Press Ctrl+C to exit.
Starting USB Server...
Waiting for SDSIO Client USB device...
USB Server running.
Ping received.
Playback: DataInput (.\DataInput.0.sds).
Record:   DataOutput (.\DataOutput.1.sds).
......
Closed:   DataInput (.\DataInput.0.sds).
Closed:   DataOutput (.\DataOutput.1.sds).
```

> Note:
>
> DataOutput file recorded during playback should be identical to one recorded during recording.

## AlgorithmTest Project

The AlgorithmTest project demonstrates real-world usage of the SDS Framework on an object detection ML model.

This project, when configured as **Recorder**:

- **Captures on-board camera stream** via SDS recording stream (DataInput.<n>.sds file)
- **Executes ML inference** using an object detection ML model
- **Captures algorithm output** via SDS recording stream (DataOutput.<n>.sds file)

Alternatively, when configured as **Player**:

- **Replays pre-recorded video stream** via SDS playback stream (DataInput.<n>.sds file)
- **Executes ML inference** using an object detection ML model
- **Captures algorithm output** via SDS recording stream (DataOutput.<m>.sds file)

### Key Components

**Video Frame Capture** (`sds_data_in_user.c`):

- Initializes on-board camera input stream using CMSIS vStream driver
- Captures video frames and processes frames for ML model input
- Provides frame data for SDS recording

**Algorithm Processing** (`sds_algorithm_user.cpp`):

- Initializes ML model and LCD display stream using CMSIS vStream driver
- Executes ML inference (pre-processing, inference, post-processing)
- Copies detection results to output buffer for SDS recording
- Displays frames on LCD with overlaid boxes using CMSIS vStream driver

One can use the **AlgorithmTest** project in a same way as **DataTest**. In VS Code, open
CMSIS view and use **Manage Solution Settings** to select **AlgorithmTest** as Active Project.
