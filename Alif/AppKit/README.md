# SDS Application on Alif AppKit board with SDSIO using USB Interface

This application shows how the SDS framework is used for testing DSP and ML algorithms. SDS enables recording and playback of real-world data streams using physical hardware
or simulation models (Arm Virtual Hardware - FVP) to an user algorithm under test. The real-world data streams are captured in SDS data files.

## Pre-Requisite

To run this example:

- Install [Keil Studio for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.keil-studio-pack) and run a blinky example on the board to verify tool installation.
- Use `cpackget add ARM::SDS` to add the SDS Framework and [Setup the SDS Python utilities](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sdsio-server).
- Setup the [Python environment](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#setup) for running the SDS Utilities.

## Ensemble E7 AI/ML AppKit

The [Alif AppKit-E7-AIML](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/alif-semiconductor-appkit-e7-aiml-gen-2-140e28d/guide/) features a dual-core Cortex-M55 each paired with an Ethos-U55 NPU.

> Note:
>
> - Configure J15-A & J15-B to position SE (Secure UART) to enable SETOOLS communication with the device.
> - Configure J15-A & J15-B to position U4 (UART4) to see printf messages from the application.

Before using this SDS examples on the board it is required to program the ATOC of the device using the Alif SETOOLS.

Refer to the section [Usage](https://github.com/alifsemi/alif_ensemble-cmsis-dfp/blob/main/docs/Overview.md)
in the overview page of the Alif Semiconductor Ensemble DFP/BSP for information on how
to setup these tools.

In VS Code use the menu command **Terminal - Run Tasks** and execute one of the following:

- "Alif: Install M55_HE or M55_HP debug stubs (single core configuration)"

## Projects

The `SDS.csolution.yml` application is configured for the targets [Alif AppKit-E7-AIML](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/alif-semiconductor-appkit-e7-aiml-gen-2-140e28d/guide/) or [AVH-SSE-300](https://github.com/ARM-software/AVH) FVP simulation models. It contains wto projects.

- **`DataTest.cproject.yml`**: Verifies the SDSIO interface on hardware.
- **`AlgorithmTest.cproject.yml`**: Verifies a user algorithm with recording and playback of SDS data files.

## Layer Type: Board

The board layer implements the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) layer. Depending on the active target that is selected, a different board layers with I/O interfaces is used:

- `Board/AppKit-E7_M55_HP/Board_HP.clayer.yml`` uses the **USB Interface** for SDS file I/O on the Alif AppKit and is configured for the High-Performance (HP) core of the device.
- `Board/Corstone-300/Board-U55.clayer.yml' uses the **VSI Interface** for SDS file I/O on AVH.

## Build Types

- **`DebugRec`**: Debug version of application used for recording of generated input data and results of simple checksum algorithm output data.
- **`DebugPlay`**: Debug version of application used for verification of SDS component, play back the previously recorded SDS file and verify results of simple checksum algorithm.
- **`ReleaseRec`**: Release version of application used for recording of generated input data and results of simple checksum algorithm output data.
- **`ReleasePlay`**: Release version of application used for verification of SDS component, play back the previously recorded SDS file and verify results of simple checksum algorithm.

> Note: Only difference between `Debug` and `Release` targets is compiler optimization level and debug information.

## DataTest Project on Alif AppKit

The DataTest project allows you to verify the SDS I/O communication and it is recommended to use this project first.  Build and run this project in VS Code using the following steps:

1. Use **Manage Solution Settings** and select as Active Project **DataTest** with Build Type **DebugRec**.
2. **Build solution** creates the executable image.
3. Connect the USB debug port (J2) of the Alif AppKit and configure jumpers for SETOOLS.
4. Use the SETOOLS and install the single core configuration.
5. **Load and Run** to download the application.
6. Configure jumpers for UART4 and use the VS Code **Serial Monitor** to observe the output below.

```txt
SDS initialization failed!
For Network and USB SDSIO Interfaces ensure that SDSIO Server is running and restart the application!
99% idle
99% idle
```

> NOTE
>
> It is possible to configure the input data bandwidth by editing `SDS_ALGO_TEST_BANDWIDTH` define in the `sds_algorithm_config.h` file.
> Default bandwidth is configured to `100000U` which means approximately 100000 bytes per second.

### Recording Test

For executing the **recording** test, follow the steps below:

1. Connect a second USB cable between Host and Alif AppKit J1 connector.
2. Open in VS Code a Terminal Window and start the [SDSIO-Server](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sdsio-server) with `sdsio-server.py usb`
3. Open the VS Code **Serial Monitor** and Start Monitoring the UART output.
4. **Load and Run** the application on the Alif AppKit.
5. Press the joystick (SW2) on the Alif AppKit to start recording.
6. Press the joystick (SW2) again to stop recording.

**Output of SDSIO Server**

```bash
>sdsio-server.py usb 
Press Ctrl+C to exit.
Starting USB Server...
USB Server running.
Stream opened: DataInput (DataInput.0.sds).
Stream opened: DataOutput (DataOutput.0.sds).
..........
Stream closed: DataInput (DataInput.0.sds).
Stream closed: DataOutput (DataOutput.0.sds).
Stream opened: DataInput (DataInput.1.sds).
Stream opened: DataOutput (DataOutput.1.sds).
```

**Output of Serial Monitor**

```txt
SDS recording started
99% idle
SDS recording stopped
99% idle
SDS recording started
```

Each run records two files: `DataInput.<n>.sds` and `DataOutput.<0>.sds` in the folder where SDSIO-Server was started. `<n>` is a sequential number.

**Check SDS Files**

The [SDS-Check](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sds-check) utility verifies SDS files for consistency. For example:

```bash
>sds-check.py -s DataInput.0.sds
File     : DataInput.0.sds
DataSize : 351.400 bytes
Records  : 350
BlockSize: 996 bytes
Interval : 10 ms
DataRate : 99.600 byte/s
Jitter   : 0 ms
Validation passed
```

### Playback Test

For executing the **playback** test, follow the steps below:

1. Use **Manage Solution Settings** and select as Active Project **DataTest** with Build Type **DebugPlay**.
2. **Build solution** creates the executable image.
3. Connect a second USB cable between Host and Alif AppKit J1 connector.
4. Open in VS Code a Terminal Window and start the [SDSIO-Server](https://arm-software.github.io/SDS-Framework/main/utilities.html#sdsio-server) with `sdsio-server.py usb`
5. **Load and Run** the application on the Alif AppKit hardware.
6. Press a joystick (SW2) on the Alif AppKit to start playback of `DataInput` and recording of `DataOutput`.
7. Wait for playback to finish, it will finish automatically when all data from `DataInput.0.sds` SDS file was played back.

The stream `DataInput.<n>.sds` is read back and the algorithm processes this data. The stream `DataOutput.<m>.sds` is written whereby `<m>` is the next available file index.

**Output of SDSIO Server**

```txt
>sdsio-server usb
SDSIO-Server USB running... Press Ctrl+C to exit.
Stream opened: DataInput (DataInput.0.sds).
Stream opened: DataOutput (DataOutput.2.sds).
...........
Stream closed: DataInput (DataInput.0.sds).
Stream closed: DataOutput (DataOutput.2.sds).
Stream opened: DataInput (DataInput.1.sds).
.
Stream opened: DataOutput (DataOutput.3.sds).
.......
Stream closed: DataInput (DataInput.1.sds).
Stream closed: DataOutput (DataOutput.3.sds).
```

## DataTest Project on AVH-FVP Simulation

The DataTest can be also executed on [AVH-FVP](https://github.com/ARM-software/AVH) simulation models using the steps below.

1. Use **Manage Solution Settings** and select:
     - Active target `AVH-SSE-300`
     - Active Project **DataTest** with Build Type **DebugRec** or **DebugPlay**.
2. **Build solution** to create an executable image.
3. **Load and Run** starts the application on the AVH-FVP simulation.  The output is shown in the Terminal console.

> NOTE
>
> The user button is simulated with the function `simGetSignal` in the file `sds_control.c`.
