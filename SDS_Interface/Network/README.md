# Network SDS Interface

The Network SDS Interface uses a Ethernet based IoT Socket communication implemented with the MDK-Middleware Network. It is based on the following components:

- [SDS Recorder](https://github.com/ARM-software/SDS-Framework/tree/main/sds#synchronous-data-stream-recorder) to stream data via
- [IoT Socket](https://mdk-packs.github.io/IoT_Socket/html/index.html) interface using
- [MDK-Middleware Network](https://arm-software.github.io/MDK-Middleware/latest/Network/index.html) module via
- [CMSIS-Driver Ethernet](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_6/latest/Driver/index.html).
